The AI image I used for this was generated by ChatGPT and was of someone uncopyrightable known as Peatur Griffen. It looked exactly like what I expeted, this particular AI model has that look automaticly and I didnt ask it to change its style so of course it came out looking like that. I used this model because its the one im familiar with and have some experiense using. However, this was the first time I made an image using it so that was kinda new. It kept telling me it could not make copywriten characters wich was weird to me because Peatur Griffen was entiraly made up by me as far as ChatGPt knows.
