I decided to make a grilled cheese and tomato soup for my assignment while chat gpt made a pizza. My grilled cheese is a little on the simple side but I think the lines I added to the bread really made it come together nicely. It is definitly not anything souper* special but its definitly good enough for me. However, Chat gpt made a pizza and they screwed up. They put their crust at the wrong end of the triangle. Does this make me better than them? Yes. They had an idea there but just couldn't finish it out.
