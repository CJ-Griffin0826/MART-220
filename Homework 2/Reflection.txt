I made my Grilled Cheese cookable when the player presses C. I think this could be tweaked a little better but it works as intended. I also included the drinking of my soup when the player clicks on the mouse. Sadly, the final pixel is still in the bowl but most of it is gone. Chat GPt kind of sucked. Their pizza could move wich was cool but their topping just kinda float if you run away from them. Overall, I think mine is better because of the floating toppings. I beat Chat GPT yet again.
